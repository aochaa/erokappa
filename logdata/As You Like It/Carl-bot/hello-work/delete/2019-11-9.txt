The syntax for adding roles is emoji then role, like `:angel: role_name`

That does not seem to be an emoji. If you insist that it is, make sure you don't have any other bots deleting messages from either of us. **Type 'done' to save and finish** or 'cancel' to discard everything.

Alright, I got a title and a description, would you like the message to have a color? Respond with the hex code or 'none' to skip.

Alright, the message will look like this. Next up we will add roles
The format for adding roles is emoji then the name of the role. When you're done, type 'done'
**Example:** ```:smile: league of legends```

Alright, the channel is <#640550691605315624>. What would you like the message to say? Use a | to separate the title from the description, like so
 ```This is a title | this is the description```
You can also type `{roles}` to have it replaced with a list of each emoji and its associated role.
